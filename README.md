# FEUP-LPOO
Project developed for Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory
The purpose of this project was to develop a program using the Object-Oriented paradigm. We made a local multiplayer game for up to 4 players. The players control their characters using their smartphones using a controller app we developed for the purpose.
The game also featured various animations, sounds and pathfinding using A* on a randomly generated level.
Players would connect to the game by scanning a QR code and the communication between the and the game is done via TCP.
Developed in Java and Android.
